                <p class="name small-header">Executive Summary:</p>
                <p class="report-description-p">A trader at Fast Forex Funding was accused of utilizing duplicate IPs, a significant rule violation, but the firm only reset the account rather than implementing a full breach. The rejection of a $9,000 payout, ongoing payment delays cited as due to operational scaling, and lack of response to a dispute notification suggest potential operational insufficiency or non-compliance with ethical standards. Comparison with the trader's successful payout at Infinity Forex Funds for the same strategy raises further questions about the legitimacy of the firm's claims.</p>

                <section class="small-header-sect">

               
                <p class="name small-header">Incident Overview</p>
                <ul>
                    <li class="report-description-p"><strong> Fast Forex Funding</strong> has alleged that the trader engaged in trading activities violating their IP usage policies. However, instead of account termination, the trader's account was merely reset. This punitive action was followed by a lack of response to a formal dispute, in which evidence was requested to substantiate the IP duplication claim. Additionally, despite acknowledged internal delays, the firm failed to process payouts, suggesting possible financial or administrative challenges.</li>
                   
                    <li class="report-description-p"><strong> Communication from the firm regarding account reset instead of termination:</strong> Fast Forex Funding decided to reset accounts rather than terminate them following allegations of IP duplication. This action suggests a preference to maintain engagement with the traders, possibly indicating operational constraints or a strategic decision to avoid severing ties completely without strong evidence of wrongdoing.</li>


  <li  class="report-description-p"><strong>Formal dispute sent to the firm requesting evidence of IP duplication: </strong>  A formal dispute was lodged against Fast Forex Funding, challenging the basis of the IP duplication claim and requesting concrete evidence. This move highlights the trader's effort to seek clarity and justice, underlining the necessity for transparency and fairness in the firm’s operations and accusations.</li>
  <li class="report-description-p"><strong>Confirmation of payout for the same strategy at Infinity Forex Funds: </strong> There was confirmation of a payout for employing the same trading strategy at Infinity Forex Funds. This outcome could indicate that the strategy itself is not inherently flawed or duplicative, further questioning the basis of Fast Forex Funding's claim and suggesting that the issue may lie more with Fast Forex Funding’s policies or procedures than with the trading strategy’s legitimacy.</li>
  <li class="report-description-p"><strong>Analysis: </strong> The combination of Fast Forex Funding's decision to reset accounts instead of terminating them, along with their lack of response to a formal dispute regarding IP duplication, casts doubt on the validity of the IP duplication claim. It suggests possible operational constraints within Fast Forex Funding that affect their capability to process payouts and respond to disputes in a timely and transparent manner. The situation underscores the importance of evidence-based accusations and the need for financial firms to handle disputes with fairness and efficiency.</li>

                                    <li class="report-description-p">The case presents a concerning pattern of non-responsive conduct and questionable punitive actions by Fast Forex Funding. The comparison with the trader’s positive experience at another prop firm casts doubt on the claims made by Fast Forex Funding. The lack of communication, particularly in not addressing a formal dispute, demonstrates a concerning disregard for transparency and fairness. In accordance with our principles of transparency and integrity, we meticulously document and analyze instances that may raise concerns. This methodical approach ensures we are equipped with a detailed and comprehensive portfolio of evidence. Such diligence prepares us for potential courses of action, including, but not limited to, the submission of whistleblower cases to regulatory authorities. One key entity in this context is the <strong> Australian Securities and Investments Commission  (ASIC</strong>), which oversees financial market integrity and consumer protection in the financial sector. Our commitment to accumulating substantial evidence aims to fortify the impact of any regulatory submissions we might make, advocating for meaningful change and adherence to industry standards

                <ul>
                <li class="report-description-p"><strong>The accusation of IP duplication by Fast Forex Funding </strong> was a critical moment, marking a significant accusation that threatened the trust and working relationship between the trader and the firm. The decision by Fast Forex Funding to reset the account instead of terminating it could initially be perceived as a lenient or constructive approach, aiming to maintain the trading relationship. However, this action, paired with the refusal to pay out $9,000 and the ongoing delays in payment attributed to operational scaling issues, begins to sketch a picture of a firm possibly struggling with internal inefficiencies or choosing not to adhere to ethical standards of business conduct.</li>
                
                <li class="report-description-p"><strong> The lack of response</strong> to a formal dispute, where evidence to support the <u> IP duplication claim was requested</u>, is particularly troubling. <i> It underscores a disregard for procedural fairness and transparency. This non-engagement is antithetical to the principles of fairness and justice in business practices, especially in industries as volatile and trust-dependent as financial trading.</i>     </li>

                <li class="report-description-p"><strong> The successful payout at Infinity Forex Funds</strong>   for employing the same strategy without issue further complicates the narrative. It suggests that the strategy itself was not inherently flawed or duplicative, challenging the basis of Fast Forex Funding's initial claim and raising questions about the firm's policies, procedures, and the legitimacy of their accusations. </li>
